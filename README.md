# SiloML Webapp

SiloML is a federated data platform for life science researchers to answer questions about clinical data that’s physically on their partners’ databases.

## Features

This is the code for the [SiloML](https://siloml.us) webapp. In the webapp:

- Data owners (provider partners) can register their data sets. They can key in an OTP on their local servers.
